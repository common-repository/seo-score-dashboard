Wondering how your website is doing in terms of search engine optimization? Find out in which areas you excel and which areas require your attention.

== Description ==

WordPress automatically solves many SEO issues. However, WordPress can't take care of all SEO factors. [SEO Bot](https://seobot.com) has constructed a website scan that scans a website on various SEO factors (both on-site and off-site). This plugin presents an aggregated result of the SEO website score for your website in the admin panel. The SEO website score is divided in 5 areas, i.e.:

* On-page score: All SEO factors that have to do with the code for specific pages of your website. For example, the presence of meta tags or the right use of heading tags.
* Website structure score: All SEO factors that have anything to do with internal linking structure and URL structure.
* Technical score: All SEO factors regarding website speed, source code correctness, and search engine crawlability.
* Link building score: How good is your backlink profile? Having highly relevant website link to you is more important than having random backlinks.
* Social media score: How active are you on social media, and how many people mention or share your website on social media platforms.

This plugin can be used inside your backend administration, so that your visitors will not see your SEO scores.

This plugin uses the external SEO Bot API server to calculate the SEO score. The API server scans the default WordPress domain (home_url) to calculate and return your SEO score. The SEO score are returned in JSON format and displayed in the widget after a few minutes of API processing time.

If the last score calculation was performed over 14 days ago a new calculation will be initiated by the external API server.

The API connection used was specially created for private WordPress use and is not intended for other types of usage outside of the WordPress administration, whether commercial or private use.
